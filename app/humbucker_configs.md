# Humbucker Configuration Reference

**Notes:**
- Red Coil = South
- Black Coil = North
- Hook-up cable always exits the baseplate below the south coil (except for reversed magnet orders)

**Configuration A (Traditional layout):**
- Bridge: South-North (Red-Black)
- Neck: North-South (Black-Red)
- Opposite magnets provide hum-cancelling

**Configuration B (Symmetrical for hum-cancelling):**
- Bridge: South-North (Red-Black)
- Neck: South-North (Red-Black)
- Same magnets, but requires opposite phase wiring
- Hum-cancelling between inner coils or outer coils of both pickups
